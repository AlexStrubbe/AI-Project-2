This Project was made as a requisite for the ICOM5015 course. The following is a description of this project.

##Search Algorithms Assignment
Objective:
The primary goal of this assignment is to implement and understand search algorithms discussed in class lectures. By applying these algorithms to practical applications such as finding the shortest path and solving puzzles, we aim to deepen our comprehension of their functionality and versatility.

Tasks:
Implement search algorithms for navigating a plane obstructed by convex polygonal obstacles.
Solve the widely recognized missionary and cannibal puzzle.
Key Challenges:
Formulating problems effectively and optimizing solutions.
Devising refined state representations and heuristic functions.
Assessing the performance of search algorithms in terms of efficiency and optimality.
Addressing nuances in seemingly simple problems like the missionary and cannibal puzzle.
